= Perception: Human perceptible printouts
http://bklippstein.github.com/perception/frames.html

Welcome to Perception. It's a intuitive toolkit for simple everyday debugging. 
Perception offers a powerfull replacement for print, puts and pp and is an alternative to Awesome Print.

You get auto-intended and structured output on your console without any configuration.

Perception also offers temporary printouts (overwritten by the next print), printing two informations 
in one line without destroying the structure and optionally slows down printing to readable speed, 
depending on the complexity of the output.

== log: use logging without configuration
You can use log instead of see, the formating is the same. 
The log directory and the logfile are automatically created if necessary.
