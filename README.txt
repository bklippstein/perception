= Perception - Readable Printouts For Logs And Console

http://bklippstein.github.com/perception/

Powerfull replacement for print, puts and pp. Intuitive toolkit for simple everyday debugging. 

You get auto-intended and structured output on your console without any configuration. 

Perception also offers temporary printouts (overwritten by the next print). So you can print
two informations in one place without destroying the structure. 

Perception optionally slows down printing to readable speed, depending on the complexity of the output.



== Usage
  require 'perception'
use +see+ instead of pp, puts, print.
[] There are demos included. Run them.
